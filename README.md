This is the Module 2 Challenge HW assignment (VBA Challenge)
This image labeled "Before running vba script" shows a screenshot of my VBA code screen and the background shows the excel workbook before running the code.

The next 3 screenshots are what my excel workbook looked like after running my code

The data is shown in the screenshots attached to this README.md file below. As you can see columns A thorugh G had pre-populated data. The task at hand was to have your code create 4 headers between columns I and L, one for ticker symbol, one for yearly change, one for percent change and one for total stock volume.
In the screenshot(s) you can see that column I has the ticker symbol showing only once and then corresponding total stock volume in column L. Other important items to note is that in column J for all three worksheets in my workbook the yearly change is from the opening price at the beginning of a give year to the closing price at the end of the year. The script also has conditional formatting that highlighted positive change in green and negative change in red. Lastly, for column K which is labeled percent change, this is the percent change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of the year for each ticker symbol. So columns J, K, and L corresponding to their respective ticker symbol in column I.
What I want to point out too, is that in my VB code I put in coding language that auto-fit the width of my new columns by the size of the corresponding text so that nothing ran into another cell as shown in my screenshots.
